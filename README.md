#🌧️Rainy Day Predictor🌧️

This app predicts the probability of rain for seven days in a given location. It uses the [Climacell API](https://www.climacell.co/weather-api/) to get the weather data and [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) to display the results.

 It is mainly used to predict rainfall and other abnormal weather for the next several days using the National Weather Service's API.


Only U.S. Locations (cities) available for now. Will add more cities and countries in the future.
